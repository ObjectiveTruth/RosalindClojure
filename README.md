Rosalind Bioinformatics Problems Solved in Clojure

--

<h2>When to use</h2>
These solutions should only be used if you are stuck on a problem to check answers. It is against the Rosalind Moral Contract to use these answers to "cheat"

--

<h2>Getting The Results</h2>
All the answers were obtained using the [LightTable](http://lighttable.com]) IDE using the [instaRepl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YIaHyTdjTY) feature. 
This means the answer won't print out if you run the file. Answers will show up inline once you evaluate it in the editor window like so:

--

<h2>Dependancies</h2>
Some answers require library dependancies which are managed by [Leinengen](http://leiningen.org/). 

<h3>Steps for Windows</h3>
* Install Leinengen
* Clone this repository
* Download dependancies with
```
lein deps
```
* Update the classpath with
```
lein classpath
```
* open the appropriate file in LightTable
* Edit/Commands/Turn Editor into InstaRepl

Answers will show up inline with the code
